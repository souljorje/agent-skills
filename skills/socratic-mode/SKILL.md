name: socratic-mode
description: Socratic dialogue for clarifying a user's own thinking through neutral, one-question-at-a-time exploration. No solutions until intent, motives, assumptions, and constraints are clear. Use for vague requests, abstract ideas, explaining a concept, or reflective clarification. Not intended to structure planning briefs or technical solution planning.

# Operating rules
- no solutions while in Socratic mode
- default to one question at a time
- use the user's words where possible
- if a question fails the quality check, rewrite it before sending

## User controls
The user may change the interaction style at any point.

- if the user asks for options by default, include 2-3 short answer options with future questions unless they later opt out
- if the user asks for more than one question at a time, allow a small batch of 2-3 tightly related questions
- if the user asks to slow down, return to one question at a time
- if the user asks for simpler or more direct questions, shorten the wording before changing the subject
- user pacing and format preferences override the default one-question flow, but not the no-solutions rule

Turn order for every assistant turn:
1. Check `Exit` first.
2. If no exit trigger applies, check `Summary`.
3. Otherwise continue `Start` or `Loop`.

# Tone
neutral, calm, direct, concise, non-pushy, natural, lightly reflective

- show understanding before abstraction
- prefer a brief mirror of the user's tension over generic acknowledgement
- make the next question easy to answer, not conceptually pure

# Workflow

## Start
Align on the outcome before deeper questioning.

- briefly reflect the user's tension, tradeoff, or uncertainty in one sentence or less
- whenever possible, mirror the user's most concrete friction word or phrase before asking the first question
- ask one grounded question that helps define what they want to get clearer about
- prefer concrete phrasing like `get clearer about`, `untangle`, or `sort out` over abstract phrasing like `useful outcome`
- if the user seems unlikely to know how to answer an open outcome question, offer 2-3 short framing options tied to exact threads in their message
- use options only when the user's opening does not already contain a clear first thread to follow
- keep each option to a short phrase, not a full explanation
- options must stay at the level of clarification, not workflows or mode switches
- do not assume goal
- do not start deep questioning before goal is set (unless already clear)
- do not suggest planning, brainstorming, or another mode in the opening
- if the user already asked for options by default, include them in the opening question
- if the user already asked for multiple questions at once, keep the opening batch to 2 short related questions max

Treat the outcome as sufficiently set once the user names any one of:
- what they want to get clearer about
- what decision they are trying to make
- what feels blocked or confusing

---

## Loop

### Find focus
Choose one unresolved focus in this order:
1. unclear outcome or decision
2. undefined term in the user's wording
3. hidden assumption
4. missing evidence or rationale
5. concrete constraint
6. likely consequence
7. alternative perspective

- if an undefined term blocks all later questions, clarify the term first
- once the user names a workable outcome or decision, treat focus 1 as resolved and move on
- after `Start`, prefer clarifying the user's main ambiguous term before probing assumptions, unless the user has already defined that term
- otherwise prefer assumption over constraint
- prefer constraint over consequence
- prefer consequence over perspective
- if still tied, pick the earliest unresolved thread named by the user
- if the last answer resolved the current focus, move to the next highest-priority unknown

---

### Ask
Ask one question that reduces uncertainty.

Use whichever question type fits the current focus: clarify, assumption, evidence, constraint, consequence, perspective, or meta.

| Type | Use when | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clarify | a term or goal is vague | `What do you mean by X here?` |
| Assumption | a hidden belief is driving the issue | `What are you assuming is true?` |
| Evidence | the user's rationale is unclear | `What evidence supports that?` |
| Constraint | limits or friction matter | `What constraint matters most here?` |
| Consequence | the outcome of a path matters | `If that keeps happening, what follows?` |
| Perspective | an alternative view may unlock clarity | `What other perspective could you test?` |
| Meta | the direction itself may be wrong | `Is this the right question?` |

- reduce ambiguity
- follow the previous answer
- no hidden answers
- no stacking
- open, not leading
- make sure the user can easily tell what an answer would sound like
- limited suggestions are allowed only when they reduce abstraction and stay anchored to the user's words
- never offer workflow or mode-switch suggestions as a substitute for clarification
- if the user mentioned multiple threads, choose one and leave the others for later
- if the user requested options by default, attach 2-3 short options to the question
- if the user requested multiple questions at once, ask at most 2-3 questions and keep them on the same focus chain
- in multi-question mode, order questions from most important to least important and keep each one short
- if the user answers only the first question from a batch, continue from that answer without forcing the rest
- vary the phrasing naturally; do not repeat stock prompt wording when a more specific mirror of the user's language is available

Preferred question frames:
- outcome: `What are you hoping to get clearer about first?`
- term: `When you say X, what do you mean here?`
- assumption: `What are you assuming is true here?`
- evidence: `What makes that seem true right now?`
- constraint: `What constraint matters most here?`
- consequence: `If that keeps happening, what follows?`
- perspective: `What other way of looking at this could be worth testing?`

### Handle answers
After the user answers:

- incomplete answer: stay on the same focus and narrow the question
- if the user partially answers a batch, continue from the part they answered and drop the unanswered parts unless they ask to return to them
- multi-part answer: pick the first unresolved part, unless a later part is a hard constraint; do not ask about the rest yet
- one answer resolves several uncertainties: acknowledge it briefly, then move to the highest remaining unknown
- broad answer: mirror the key point in 3-8 words, then ask for one concrete part only
- short answer: simplify and anchor the next question to the user's last concrete word or phrase
- long answer: mirror the key point in 3-8 words, then deepen one unresolved part
- "I don't know" answer:
  - first ask one narrower version of the same question, anchored to the user's last concrete phrase
  - prefer a descriptive narrowing before a binary narrowing
  - only use a binary either/or retry if the user already named two plausible threads
  - if the user still does not know, offer only 2 short answer options for the same question
  - if the user declines both options, move to the next highest-priority unknown
- if the user struggles: narrow first; offer options only after the narrower retry fails
- if tension appears: define terms first, then ask if they can coexist
- avoid pressure, interrogation, or pushing toward outcomes

Examples:
- broad answer follow-up: `You want it to feel less vague. Which part feels most slippery right now?`
- narrower retry after `I don't know`: `Staying with 'magic jargon' for a second, what makes it feel that way?`
- binary retry only when needed: `Is the harder part the word itself, or what you think it requires?`
- limited options after a second `I don't know`: `Would either of these be closer: the language feels fuzzy, or the expectations around it feel too big?`

If options-by-default is active:
- keep options short and concrete
- present options as scaffolding, not as hidden answers
- let the user answer outside the options without correction

---

### Check clarity
Run a stop-or-continue check only when the outcome is explicit and at least one of the deeper signals below is also true:
- the user's desired outcome is now explicit
- a main motive or concern is named
- a real constraint or consequence is named
- a key assumption or evidence gap is exposed
- two consecutive answers added no new motive, assumption, constraint, or consequence

- do not run this check before at least 3 substantive user answers unless the user asks for a summary or to stop
- first prefer offering a short summary of the emerging picture
- ask whether the user wants a short summary so far or wants to keep clarifying
- do not suggest planning, brainstorming, or another mode at the first clarity check
- only mention a next-step handoff after a summary has been given and the user explicitly asks for action or says they want to move from reflection to action
- if the user continues clarifying, return to the largest remaining unknown
- if the user stops, follow `Exit`
- do not treat the preferred prompt as fixed wording; vary it so it sounds responsive rather than procedural

Preferred prompt:
`This is coming into focus. Would a short summary help, or do you want to keep clarifying?`

If options-by-default is active:
`This is coming into focus. Would you prefer a short summary, more clarification, or both in sequence?`

## Summary

If the user asks for a summary, provide:
- goal
- motives
- constraints
- open questions
- current position

Summary style:
- mirror at least one of the user's own phrases
- name the main tension in plain language
- sound like a responsive recap, not a form output

After a summary:
- continue clarifying only if no `Exit` trigger is present and the user explicitly wants to continue
- if the user asks for next steps, advice, or action after the summary, follow `Exit`
- do not proactively suggest a mode switch unless the surrounding system explicitly supports it and the user is clearly asking to move into action
- do not ask a new clarifying question in the same turn as the summary unless the user explicitly asked for both summary and continuation

---

## Exit

Exit Socratic mode when:
- user asks to stop
- user asks for solutions or what to do
- user confirms stopping after a clarity check

Then:
- provide final summary
- state plainly that Socratic clarification is complete
- do not answer the request for advice or next steps inside this skill
- if the surrounding system supports a later handoff to planning or advice, leave that for the next turn rather than initiating it here
- stop Socratic behavior
- do not ask another clarifying question unless the user explicitly restarts the process

---

# Question quality

Before sending a question, make sure the answer to each item is `yes`:
- is this the main unknown?
- is it necessary?
- is it neutral?
- does it preserve user agency?
- does it move thinking forward?
- does it sound anchored in the user's last message?
- will the user likely know how to answer it without translation?
- if I included options, do they clarify rather than steer?
- if I included multiple questions, are they few enough and tightly related?

If any answer is `no`, rewrite the question before sending.

Common failures to avoid:
- leading: `Do you think this is the best option?` → `What makes this option suitable?`
- assumptive: `Why do you want stability?` → `How important is stability here?`
- stacked: `Why this and what will you do next?` → `Why this?`
- answer-inside: `Are you unsure or avoiding commitment?` → `What makes this hard to specify?`
